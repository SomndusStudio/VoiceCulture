# SS Voice Culture Plugin

**VoiceCulture** is a localization-ready voice-over plugin for Unreal Engine.  
It introduces a custom sound asset (`USSVoiceCultureSound`) that automatically plays the correct voice line based on the game's active language or culture.

It also provides powerful editor tools to track localization coverage, organize voice actors, and auto-populate missing audio using naming strategies.


## ‚ú® Features

- `USSVoiceCultureSound`: a culture-aware sound asset supporting multiple localized voice lines
- Automatic resolution of the correct voice asset at runtime (with fallback support)
- Full compatibility with native UE audio systems (`AudioComponent`, `AnimNotifies`, `Dialogue`, etc.)
- Custom editor dashboard with:
  - Culture coverage report and progress per language
  - Voice actor grouping via naming conventions
  - Filters for missing/complete cultures
  - Auto-population of missing voice lines
- Strategy system with pluggable profiles (supporting custom naming conventions)
- Blueprint & C++ APIs for full control
